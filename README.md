# TestingWebHosting
Using a Template to try out webhosting


I am using a Teamplate for a static web page and editing it to test how webhosting will work via GitHub
I do not claim ownership of the code written here or in any subsequent branches. 
I have edited it and added my own pictures.
The goal for this was to understand how to create and host a static webpage using gh-pages from GitHub
